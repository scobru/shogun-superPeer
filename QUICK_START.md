   - Click **"Open Anyway"**
   - Run the command again

6. **Done!** Your Gun relay server is now running on `http://localhost:8080`

7. **Test** by opening your browser and going to: `http://localhost:8080`

nohup ./shogun-superPeer-macos > server.log 2>&1 &
```

## What is this?

**Shogun SuperPeer** is a Gun database relay server. It helps decentralized applications (dApps) sync data between users without needing a central server.

### What does it do?
- Acts as a sync point for Gun database
- Stores and forwards data between peers
- Provides persistence (saves data to disk)
- Enables real-time data synchronization

### Who needs this?
- Developers building decentralized apps
- Users who want to run their own Gun node
- Communities wanting to support peer-to-peer networks

## Ports

By default, the server uses:
- **HTTP:** Port 8080
- **HTTPS:** Port 8443 (if SSL is enabled)

Make sure these ports are not used by other applications.

### Changing the port

Edit the `PORT` environment variable:

**Windows:**
```cmd
set PORT=3000
shogun-superPeer.exe
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
PORT=3000 ./shogun-superPeer-linux
```

## Firewall

If you want other computers to connect to your relay:

**Windows Firewall:**
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Advanced settings"
3. Click "Inbound Rules" ‚Üí "New Rule"
4. Select "Port" ‚Üí Next
5. Select "TCP" and enter port "8080"
6. Allow the connection
7. Name it "Shogun SuperPeer"

**Linux (UFW):**
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Usually no action needed for incoming connections on localhost
# For external access, go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Firewall
```

## Connecting from Apps

Once your relay is running, configure your Gun apps to use it:

```javascript
const gun = Gun({
  peers: ['http://localhost:8080/gun']
});
```

Or if running on a server with public IP:
```javascript
const gun = Gun({
  peers: ['http://your-server-ip:8080/gun']
});
```

## Data Storage

The server stores data in the folder where it runs:
- **data/** - Gun database files
- **radata/** - Additional persistence data

### Backup your data

Simply copy the `data/` and `radata/` folders.

### Clear all data

Stop the server and delete the `data/` and `radata/` folders.

## Troubleshooting

### "Port already in use"
Another application is using port 8080. Either:
- Close the other application
- Change the port (see "Changing the port" above)

### "Permission denied"
On Linux/macOS, make sure the file is executable:
```bash
chmod +x shogun-superPeer-*
```

### "Cannot open because it's from an unidentified developer" (macOS)
1. Right-click the file
2. Select "Open"
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog

Or use command line:
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shogun-superPeer-macos
```

### Server doesn't respond
1. Check if it's actually running (look for the process)
2. Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:8080` instead of localhost
3. Check if firewall is blocking it
4. Check the logs for error messages

### High CPU usage
This is normal when:
- Syncing large amounts of data
- Many peers are connected
- Running on slow hardware

To reduce CPU usage, disable some features in the config.

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced users, you can modify the source code before building:

1. Download the source code
2. Edit `index.js`
3. Change configuration variables at the top
4. Build your custom executable (see BUILD.md)

## Support

- **Issues:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/scobru/shogun-superPeer/issues)
- **Documentation:** [README.md](README.md)
- **Gun Docs:** [gun.eco/docs](https://gun.eco/docs/)

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
- The default configuration is for **local/private networks only**
- Do NOT expose directly to the internet without additional security
- Consider using HTTPS (requires SSL certificate)
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) for production deployments
- Keep the software updated

## Performance Tips

- **SSD recommended** for data storage
- **At least 2GB RAM** for moderate usage
- **Stable network connection** for best sync performance
- **Open necessary firewall ports** if hosting publicly

## Uninstall

Simply delete the executable file and the data folders. There's no system-wide installation.
